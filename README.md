# Think Globally, Discuss PL Locally

In-person meetings can be hugely beneficial for academic research. In SIGPLAN, we have four yearly
flagship conferences that bring people together, but big international conferences are not the only
way to facilitate face-to-face interactions. In this post, we discuss the value of
_local PL conferences_; we describe what they are, why they are valuable, and how you (yes, you!)
can organize one for your corner of the PL world.

## The Benefits of Local Conferences

Local PL conferences are not new. In the Northeast of the US, conferences like the New Jersey
Programming Languages and Systems Symposium (NJPLS) and the New England Programming Languages and
Systems Symposium (NEPLS) have been running on and off since 1994 and 2000 respectively, and there
are many other local PL conferences that are already happening in other parts of the world. (Note,
for simplicity we use the word "conference" to refer to all of these kinds of events, even though
some call themselves "symposia," "colloquia," etc.)

These events generally last a single day and consist of a series of talks from mostly students. The
talks vary in topic and scope. They can include (but are not limited to):
- research talks on work-in-progress;
- non-research talks that are of general interest to PL researchers;
- practice talks for larger conferences (especially from students who have not given many talks
  before);
- keynotes from local industry or academic leaders.
The talks are often a bit less formal than a major conference talk but more formal than a reading
group chalk-talk. As with larger conferences, local conferences also include coffee breaks and
lunches that give attendees a chance to catch up, discuss the talks, plan collaborations, etc.

Local conferences have some distinct benefits that complement the benefits of SIGPLAN's
international conferences. First, local conferences are extremely accessible. By definition they are
physically accessible to the intended attendees, as they do not require significant travel. This
makes local conferences easier to attend for people with families that they need to care for, people
whose travel is restricted because of visa / immigration status, and anyone else who finds travel
difficult. Local travel is also generally inexpensive, and local conferences are usually either
inexpensive or free to attend, so local conferences are economically accessible. And local
conferences are can also be very socially accessible---when managed correctly, local conferences can
be supportive environments that are great first venues for students to attend and give talks.

Another key benefit is frequency. Local conferences are relatively lightweight, so they can be run
multiple times a year without becoming too much of a burden. They are relatively easy to host---a
few students with support from a faculty member can manage it without too much trouble---and they
only require enough funding to pay for space and lunch. Higher frequency means that local
conferences can give researchers more opportunities throughout the year to connect with their
colleagues in person.

## NJPLS and Reusable Materials

The authors of this post have all been recent organizers of
[New Jersey Programming Languages and Systems Symposium (NJPLS)](https://njpls.org/).
NJPLS is a local PL conference that has been running on and off since 1994. It paused for a while
from 2017 to 2022, but since then it's been running bi-yearly consistently. Attendance at NJPLS has
grown to over 100 participants per meeting, and we consistently get more great talk proposals than
we can support.

We think that much of the recent success of NJPLS can be attributed to streamlined organization.
Over the last few years, we have been maintaining reusable materials that serve as a starting point
for new organizers. These include:
- a manual that points out important details for organizing;
- a website template;
- templates for name tags, flyers, etc.;
- registration forms.
These materials mean that each new NJPLS organizer doesn't need to reinvent the wheel---they have a
solid base to build on, and many of the hard parts are already taken care of for them.

The NJPLS organization materials are living documents; each new organizer is expected to contribute
back, adding notes about their experiences and addressing issues that they ran into. In this way,
the document becomes even more helpful over time.

## It's Your Turn!

After putting the NJPS materials through their paces for a few years, we think it is time to share
them more broadly. The materials have already been used beyond NJPLS---they are currently being used
to help kickstart the Upstate PL conference in upstate New York---but until recently they were not
officially publicly available. However, we are now happy to announce that we have released the NJPLS
materials publicly as the **Local PL Conference Manual** on
[GitHub](https://github.com/hgoldstein95/local-pl-conference-manual), which anyone is free to use
and contribute to.

In the coming years, we hope you consider starting your own local PL conferences, wherever you
happen to be doing PL research. If you use our materials as a starting point, please let us know,
and please contribute notes about your experiences to the GitHub repo. We hope to facilitate a broad
network of PL meetups so that anyone who is interested in PL but doesn't have the time or resources
to attend a major conference has somewhere to connect in-person with our amazing community.
